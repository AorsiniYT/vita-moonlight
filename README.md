# Moonlight Vita

Moonlight Vita is a Moonlight client for PS Vita and PSTV, based on Moonlight
Embedded. It streams games and applications from a Sunshine-compatible host.

## Features

- Hardware H.264 decoding on PS Vita
- Low-latency GXM presentation
- Host discovery, pairing and Wake-on-LAN
- Touchscreen, rear touchpad, motion and configurable shortcuts
- Optional microphone forwarding through Moonmic
- Borealis-based interface with controller and touch navigation

## Requirements

- PS Vita or PSTV with homebrew support
- VitaShell for VPK installation
- A PC running Sunshine or another compatible GameStream host
- A stable local network; Ethernet is recommended for the host PC

## Installation

1. Copy `moonlight_vita.vpk` to the Vita.
2. Install the package with VitaShell.
3. Start Moonlight from LiveArea and pair it with the host.

## Building

Linux, WSL and Windows/MSYS2 use the same build scripts. Install VitaSDK first
and make sure `VITASDK/bin` is available in `PATH`.

Clone the repository and its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/AorsiniYT/vita-moonlight.git
cd vita-moonlight
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Linux

Install the host tools. On Debian or Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build git curl wget unzip \
    libarchive-tools pkg-config fakeroot patch python3 bzip2 xz-utils
```

Install VitaSDK following the [official VitaSDK instructions](https://vitasdk.org/),
then export its location:

```bash
export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH="$VITASDK/bin:$PATH"
```

### WSL

Use a current WSL2 distribution and install the same packages listed for Linux.
Install VitaSDK inside WSL, normally at `/usr/local/vitasdk`; do not reuse a
Windows VitaSDK installation. Keeping the repository in the WSL filesystem
(for example `~/src/vita-moonlight`) avoids slow builds and permission issues on
`/mnt/c`.

```bash
export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH="$VITASDK/bin:$PATH"
```

If the source must remain on a mounted Windows drive, place build outputs in the
WSL filesystem:

```bash
export VITA_BUILD_ROOT="$HOME/.cache/vita-moonlight-build"
```

### Windows/MSYS2

Run the commands from the MSYS2 `MSYS` shell. Install the required host tools:

```bash
pacman -S --needed make git curl wget unzip libarchive cmake ninja pkgconf \
    patch python diffutils sed grep findutils tar
```

Set `VITASDK` to the installed SDK. POSIX and Windows paths are both accepted:

```bash
export VITASDK=/usr/local/vitasdk
export PATH="$VITASDK/bin:$PATH"
```

### Dependencies

Install the Vita libraries and the FFmpeg-vita fork:

```bash
./scripts/prepare/install_all.sh
```

The normal GXM build does not require PVR_PSP2. Install it only for the optional
GLES backend:

```bash
./scripts/prepare/install_all.sh --with-pvr
```

### Compile

To build a release VPK with GXM without deploying it:

```bash
./makepsv --gxm --release --no-deploy
```

Run `./makepsv` without arguments to open the interactive builder. Build
directory names include the host and graphics backend, such as
`cmake-build-psv-linux-gxm`, `cmake-build-psv-wsl-gxm` or
`cmake-build-psv-msys2-gxm`. Set `VITA_BUILD_ROOT` to place these directories
outside the source tree.

For fast incremental builds and direct deployment, copy the IP template first:

```bash
cp ip_vita.txt.example ip_vita.txt
./makefast
```

`makefast --no-deploy` only builds the application and does not require an IP
file. Deployment expects VitaShell FTP on port 1337 and Vita Companion control
on port 1338.

See [scripts/prepare/README.md](scripts/prepare/README.md) for dependency details
and troubleshooting.
